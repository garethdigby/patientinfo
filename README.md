# Patient Info
This is a repository of information gathered and code developed for the `cycle-health-patientinfo` pod in [The Upskilling Labs](https://theupskillinglabs.org/#home) Q1 2026 **AI & Health Systems** cohort.

## AI & Health Systems
The **AI & Health Systems** cohort will build projects, test new skills, and leaning on one another to reimagine what work can look like in the age of AI.

# Patient Info Problem Statement

**The Problem**: Healthcare system silos make it difficult for patients to share their ongoing healthcare information with providers as the patients move between providers.

**Context**: Patients are repeatedly asked to provide their health history when seeing a healthcare provider. When new information is available from one provider the patient is often the messenger who has to hand-carry the information to another provider. The need for the patient to transpose and transmit their health data can potentially lead to errors or omissions especially during time-critical periods.  

**Who is closest to this problem**: Individuals / Workers.

**Why it matters now**: Improving the flow of patient information between providers offers the potential to improve healthcare outcomes. Rather than trying to break down the silos between systems, there is an opportunity for individuals to be in control of their own healthcare information in an accurate and timely manner.

# The Upskilling Labs Approach

The Upskilling Labs approach is in three phases.

1. ***Specify*** a problem statement.  
2. ***Research*** the problem as part of a team (aka **pod**) to understand the problem in more detail and also understand what you do not know about the problem space. A goal of this phase is to identify what you do not know.  
3. ***Develop*** and present solutions to the problem.

An underlying thread thru The Upskilling Labs approach is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to assist in the research of the problem and the development of a solution.
