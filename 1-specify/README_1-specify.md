# Patient Information Silos Problem Specification  

During the problem specification phase a problem related to healthcare is proposed. In addition to the problem, the context, who is closest to the problem, and why the problem matters now, are also included in the problem statement.  

# Patient Info Problem Statement

**The Problem**: Healthcare system silos make it difficult for patients to share their ongoing healthcare information with providers as the patients move between providers.

**Context**: Patients are repeatedly asked to provide their health history when seeing a healthcare provider. When new information is available from one provider the patient is often the messenger who has to hand-carry the information to another provider. The need for the patient to transpose and transmit their health data can potentially lead to errors or omissions especially during time-critical periods.  

**Who is closest to this problem**: Individuals / Workers.

**Why it matters now**: Improving the flow of patient information between providers offers the potential to improve healthcare outcomes. Rather than trying to break down the silos between systems, there is an opportunity for individuals to be in control of their own healthcare information in an accurate and timely manner.
